ABOUT
This extension enables you to display the base price for products.  E.g. if you sell
different quantities of oil, you can enter the amount each bottle contains (like 250ml)
and a reference unit (like liter), and the price per liter is calculated and displayed.

What can be configured:
- Product Unit:
   The packaging unit of your products: Milliliter, Gram, Centimeter, Milligram,...

- Product Amount:
   The amount of the packaging unit (e.g. 100g)

- Reference Unit:
   The unit the price should be calculated for. It should match the type of unit chosen
   for the product (Milliliter to Liter, Milligram to Gram or Kilogram, Centimeter to Meter,...)

- Reference Amount:
   Probably you will want to have 1 (one) as the reference amount. But if you want to have a
   different amount, you can choose one here.


You can specify defaults on a global, website or store view scope for all products
in the admin interface under System / Catalog / Hide Prices

You can override those default settings in the Product Management page at
Catalog / Manage Products / (Choose a Product) / Prices

In the configuration you may also disable the extension on a store view scope.


NOTICE
This extension provides base prices for simple products. We provide a commercial
Extension that extends the BasePrice Module to add support for custom options,
configurable products and bundled products. You can purchase that module on the
http://der-modulprogrammierer.de website.


UNINSTALL
If you ever uninstall the extension (I don't hope so ;)) your site will be broken, because
Magento doesn't support a mechanism to remove attributes with an extension, and this
extension uses source models.
To fix the Error, you have to execute the following SQL:

   DELETE FROM `eav_attribute` where attribute_code IN ('base_price_amount','base_price_unit','base_price_base_amount','base_price_base_unit');   
   DELETE FROM `core_resource` where code = 'baseprice_setup';

Afterwards don't forget to clear the cache.


CHANGELOG
0.1.0 Initial Release
